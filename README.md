This is a simple quiz application that allows the user to pick which Star Wars topic they want to take a quiz on. When you load the Website you will see a short description of how to use the quiz app. There is a choose quiz button that when clicked displays a modal box that asks the user what type of Star Wars quiz they want to take. Once the user selects an option and clicks on Start Quiz, the main Star Wars theme starts playing and a timer for five seconds starts counting down. After the timer reaches 0, the first set of questions and answers appears. When the user selects an answer, they will be told if they were correct or wrong, and then the next question and answers will display. Once they answer all 10 questions or the minute timer hits 0, the quiz ends. The user will see a text input where they can enter their initials and click submit. After they hit submit they are taken to the High Scores page where they can see a list of all their high scores with their initials. From here the user can either clear all of their highscores or click the back button to go back to the main page of the quiz to take the quiz again.
